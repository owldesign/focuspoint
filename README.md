# Focuspoint plugin for Craft CMS

![Focuspoint](http://craftcms-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/focuspoint/focuspoint.png)

Focuspoint lets you select a focal point of an image asset. 


## Installation

To install focuspoint, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `focuspoint` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/owldesign/focuspoint.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
4. The plugin folder should be named `focuspoint` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.
5. Currently only supports css background images (no <img> tag focuspoints, but will add later).

focuspoint works on Craft Craft 2.5.x.
